Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{12pt}

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer position.  My experience in developing and deploying tools for manufacturing and field support, coupled with my proven ability to debug and troubleshoot system software anomalies, aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the job description.

\vspace{12pt}

My background includes developing a Qt (C++) and QML-based framework for automated testing of manufacturing equipment, which reduced testing time by 20% and improved diagnostic accuracy by 15\%. This project, completed between January 2024 and May 2025, directly demonstrates my proficiency in automated software testing using Squish, as well as my expertise in Qt (C++) and QML.  Furthermore, I successfully classified and categorized 500+ software anomalies, showcasing my skills in identifying and categorizing system issues, a crucial aspect of the role.

\vspace{12pt}

My experience extends to building a Qt (C++) application for field technicians to diagnose and troubleshoot issues remotely, reducing onsite support calls by 25\%.  This project, which I have been working on since June 2024, showcases my ability to develop tools for field support and highlights my commitment to enhancing efficiency.  The tool's integration with a central database to collect diagnostic data further improved issue resolution time by 18\%, demonstrating my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.  My work also involved the development of a machine learning model to classify system anomalies with 95\% accuracy, improving troubleshooting efficiency and reducing false-positive alerts by 30\%.

\vspace{12pt}

Throughout my experience at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I consistently demonstrated my expertise in object-oriented programming (C++) and my ability to collaborate effectively with stakeholders to translate user requirements into technical specifications.  I improved API response times by 15\% in one role and reduced reported issues by 10\% in another through proactive bug identification and resolution.
