Weâ€™re partnering with a stealth-mode client building the next frontier in spatial computingâ€”and theyâ€™re hiring a Full-Stack Lead Engineer to help architect and scale the foundation of the Spatial Internet. This is a full-time role with competitive comp + equity, available remotely but only for candidates based in Los Angeles.
What Youâ€™ll Build
Youâ€™ll lead development across three core products:
- Bubblzz â€“ A real-time spatial logic engine that coordinates objects, content, users, and
behaviors across physical locations.
- AirScene â€“ A creation platform for designing, scripting, and deploying interactive
environments using spatial and event-driven logic.
- LightPlay â€“ A mobile/web interface for users to experience and interact with these
programmable environments in real time.
You will help define how relationships between objects, users, environments, and events are
modeled and executed at scaleâ€”forming the programmable structure of the spatial internet.
What We're Looking For
Required:
- 5+ years in full-stack development
- Experience with distributed systems
- Proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and React
- REST & WebSocket API design for real-time apps
- Backend experience with SQL or NoSQL databases
- Strong architectural thinking and leadership experience
- Familiarity with dynamic interaction systems (e.g. behaviors, permissions, environments)
Nice to Have:
- Graph databases (Neo4j, AWS Neptune, etc.)
- Geospatial data or 3D modeling knowledge
- Event-driven/pub-sub systems (Kafka, Redis, MQTT)
- Experience in AR, simulations, or multiplayer systems
- Real-time collaboration and user permissions
- Web3 identity systems (DIDs, wallets, etc.)
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
Why JoinÂ 
- Founding-level equity + direct product ownership
- Work on patented infrastructure already adopted by global partners
- Help define a new computing paradigm
- See your work deployed in arenas, theaters, festivals, and cities
- Join a visionary team shaping the future of real-world interactivity
ðŸŽ¯ Note: Applicants must be based in Los Angeles, even though the role is remote.
