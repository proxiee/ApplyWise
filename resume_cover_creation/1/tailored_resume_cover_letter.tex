Hiring Manager


I am writing to express my keen interest in the Full-Stack Lead Engineer position, as posted on your job board.  My three-plus years of experience in full-stack development, coupled with my proven ability to architect and scale applications for real-time, spatial computing solutions, strongly align with the requirements outlined in the job description.  My expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and React, along with my experience designing REST and WebSocket APIs for real-time applications, makes me a highly suitable candidate.

During my tenure as a Full-Stack Java Developer at Cognizant Technology Solutions | Titan, I spearheaded the implementation of a new microservice architecture, resulting in a twenty percent improvement in system scalability and a twenty percent reduction in latency.  Furthermore, I played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining key features for a high-traffic application, leading to a fifteen percent increase in user engagement.  This accomplishment directly demonstrates my ability to deliver impactful results in high-pressure environments, a skill I am eager to leverage in contributing to your company's mission.  My experience extends to migrating applications to cloud-based infrastructures, successfully reducing infrastructure costs by ten percent.

Beyond my professional experience, my personal projects further showcase my capabilities.  My work on the "Real-time Collaboration Platform" using WebSockets demonstrates my proficiency in building seamless real-time communication systems, a skill crucial for your "Bubblzz" and "LightPlay" products.  Similarly, my "Spatial Logic Engine Prototype," developed using Node.js and a NoSQL database, along with my experience designing and implementing REST and WebSocket APIs, directly addresses the core requirements of your "Bubblzz" project. The "Interactive 3D Environment" project, built using WebGL and Three.js, showcases my understanding of 3D modeling and interactive systems, a valuable skill set for the "AirScene" product.

My strong architectural thinking, leadership experience, and passion for building innovative real-time applications make me confident in my ability to make significant contributions to your team.  I am particularly excited by the opportunity to help shape the future of spatial computing and am eager to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the success of your groundbreaking initiatives.


Sincerely,

Sanaharika Thallada
